nates to reinstate the Legate in his former
station of J usticiar. Amongst other reasons,
they urged that it would much displease
the King‚ to know how Longchamp had
been thus displaced srom the govemment
of the Kingdom without his command.
A strange assertion this, in the face of the
letters patent by which John and his par-
tizans had effected Longchamp’s expulsion‚
but entirely conformable to Longchamp’s
declarations: and confirmed, indeed, by
what is stated, that Richard's determination
to return to England was accelerated by
the intelligence of Longchamp’s removal
Taken any way, such an argument is a

strong exemplification of the prevailing

wantos truth and principle.

Of J ohu's exertions on behalf of Long-
ehamp, one example is narrated with
amusing particularity. A Council or, as
we should call it, a Parliament‚ being as-
sembled at london, the messenger of
Longchamp, Legata and Chaucellor‚ sud-

denly entered, announoing the arrival .

of hia master at Dover. Alarmed at such
intelligence, they forthwith send to Earl
John, who is at Wallingsord. Another
Counail is held. Iu this, John informs
them that Longchamp defies them all,
provided he can obtain his, John’s‚ pro-
tection, for which he offers seven hun·-
dred pounds‚ to be pald within a weelr.
