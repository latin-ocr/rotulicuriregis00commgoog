xcviii INTRODUCTION.

§XLVlIk One of the works contem·
plated by Sir Simon D’Ewes was, “The
‘⁶ antiquity of the Municipal or Com·
“ mon law of the Realm before the Nor-
“man Conquest‚ out of records for the
“greatest part, or other unvulgar mate-
“ rials ;’'- to this he intended to add a
second part out of the ‘⁶ Itinerant and Plea
‘⁶ Rolls, chiefly remaining in the Treasury
‘⁶ at Westminster,”-or the muniments of
which this present publication is composed.
—“These‚''— he continues—⁶⁶ 1 have pro-
‘⁶ posed to myself to labour in,besides divers
‘⁶ other smaller works, as well theological
‘⁶ as moral, like him that shoots at the Sun,
‘⁶ not in hopes to reach it, but to shoot as
‘⁶ high as possibly his strength, art, or skill
“will permit. · Se, though I know it is
‘⁶ impossible to linish all these during my
“short and uncertain life, having already
⁶‘ entred into the thirtieth year of my age,
‘⁶ and having many unavoidable imploy·
‘⁶ ments and cares of an estate and family,
⁶‘ yet if Ι can finish a little in each kind, it
‘⁶ may hereafler stir up some able judg-
mmmfflmmmmmwn
“ the same way and search 1 shall have
“ waded in before them. In the mean
‘⁶ time Ι shall always pray, as I do sin·
