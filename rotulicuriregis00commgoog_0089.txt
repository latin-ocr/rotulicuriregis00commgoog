Ralph de Dicam, a most trusty and ac-
curate testimony, was not acquainted with
the history os the measure, and commemo-
rates Peter Bosil -and not Bertrom dc
Gurdon-as the soldier by whose arrow
Richard was strichen. And the chronicle of
Dunstaple‚ the Annals of Margan, Matthew
Paris (or rather Roger Wendover), and
Walsingham, relating the story of the trea-
sure, all designate the same Peter Bosil as
the youth by whom the quarrell was dis·
charged. ’

The manuscript chronicle of Winchester
agrees with the last preceding authorities
in naming Peter Bosil as the man, but
differs from them by ascribing to this indi·
vidual the unhappy sate of Bertrom dc Gur·
don, and yet witha variatim· Murcadeus
surrendered the prisoner to Richard's sister
Joan‚ Countess of StGiles, aod she, and
not Mareadeus, plucked out his eyes, and
caused him to suffer other horrible mutila-
tions aud tortores, under which he expired.

The anonymous continuator of Geoffry,
the Prior os Vigeois, aLimoisin Monastery,

⁵ places two knights, Peter Bru (perhaps

Bam) and Peter Bosil, in the tower from
whence the missile proceeded: and adds,
that as it was reported, -a report which
he repeats without positively adopting it,-
Petcr Bosil was the marksman.
