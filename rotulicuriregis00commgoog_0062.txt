memorials relating to his transactions on

the Rolls os the Coria Regis, clearly declare
that the writs issued by Longchamp the
Chaneellor‚ emanated from the junsdiction

of Longchamp the Chief J usticiar.
To these secular powers, were added the

vast ecclesiastical authority which he de·
rived frorn his legatine commission. He is
represented as tyrannizing equally over
clergy and laity, confounding right and
wrong, offending and oppressing the whole
community by his insolence and rapacity.
‘⁴ Had he continued in office,’'- said his
enemies,-“ the kingdom would have been
‘⁶ wholly exhausted‚ notagirdlewould have

“ “ remained to the man, nor a bracelet to

‘⁸ the woman, nor a ring to the knight, nor
“ egem to the jew.''- Most violent dis·
sensions arose between the Chief J usticiar
ou the one part, and Earl John and the
Magnetes ou the other part: and they ad-
dressed a letter to Richard, who was then
on his voyage to Palestine, declanng the
fearful mischiels which the Justiciar was
occasioniug to King and Kingdom. But,
before we adurit the truth of these accusa-
uons, we must pause. TheJusticiarsteadily
opposed and counteracted the preten-
sions of John, who was endeavouring to
secure his succession to the throne; and

we may suspect that a portion, and pro·
anacteam. d
