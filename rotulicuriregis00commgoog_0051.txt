xxxviii lNTRODUCTION.

Quinzaine of nran. Iri an assize concerning a virgate of

lidii? the land in Pertinges in the county of Sussex,

Μ’· it was found to be the lay see ol Peter, the
son of Henry the Mayor of London‚ and
of Ysabella the wife of the said Peter.
This last entry is carious as giving some
particulars with respect to Fitz Ailwin’s
family.

It may not be unimportant to add, that, Appx.L

in a grant rnade by Fitz Ailwin, one of

the persons vouched in the attesting clause
is Radulphus Brand, probably a kinsnran of
Robert Brand. And, narned in the same
character of witnesses are “ J ordanus filius
Sperling‚'' and “Jordanus lilius Jordani‚''

either of whom may be the same individua}
asJordan the Tanner. The seal of this
document is much delaced‚ but enough re·-
mains to shew that Fitz Ailwin was repre-
sented with hawlr 0n fist, in baronial guise.
And the seal comes in support of the old
tradition of London‚ that the Alderrnen
ranked as Barons. Such tokens of station
were not assumed without due warrant.

Some particulars concerning the topo-
graphy of Loudon may be collected frorn
the Rolls. Newgate, under the narne ol
Now-port, was already used as a gaol.
“Old street without London'' then and
now still bears in its name the memorial oi
its Rornan antiquity.
