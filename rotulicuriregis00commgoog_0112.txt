INTRODUCTION. xcix

‘⁶ cerely desire, that by all my endeavours
“ God may he glorified, the truth, divine
‘¹ or human, vindicated, and the publick
‘⁴ benefited:

‘⁶ Sic mihi contingat vivere, sieque mori.”

Such remarks arctoo instructive to be
omitted. They are the memorials of a
period when the individuals most distin·
guished by knowledge, by learning, or by
intellectual eminenee, were impressed with
the deep feeling of the duties resulting srorn
the important station whereunto they had
been called. Raised up as teachers, freely
dispensing the gins freely bestowed upon
thenr, seeking neither present fame· nor ’
worldly profit, but acting under an hnmhle
‘responsibility for the faithful use of the
talents entrustedto their stewardship. And
indeed, these sentiments and principles
will alone enable the inquiret to proceed
steadily and cheerfully, in labours, which
even humanly speaking, can never· be
ripcned into harvest, until the hand that
sowed the seed is mouldering in the grave.
Pursued with any other rnotives, the drcary
annals of literary history will warn him how
little chance he has of escaping srorn the
nrost bitter vexation, sorrow, or despair.
