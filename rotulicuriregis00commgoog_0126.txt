Pope was startled end scared, and after expressing his surprise

to the Cardinals in somevhat unseemly languege he turned to
the Monk, and said, “ Brother, by St Peter you shall not vvait
for my death, your petition is grmted ;” end before Pope lnno·
cent again tasted fond he issued the Bull by which Archbishop
Hubert was sntlroriaed to restore the Monastery.

Now as this statement is wholly inconsistent with the Bull‚
which ispreserved textuelly and entire, we must either admit
that the documentis efurgery -and, at this period, the practice
of fabricating spurious Bulls preveiled exceedingly-or thet
Metthevv Paris, the Monlr of St. Albane, was singularly
deceived.

Itis probable that Hubert was the vard of Glanville. He 'thus
expresses himself on the Foundation Charter of West Dereharn.-
Omnibus Sanctae Matris Ecclesioe filiis, presentibus et futuris,
Hubertus Dei gratia, Eboracensis ecclesiae Decanus‚ aeternam in
'Domino salutern. Sapientis est hiis, quae salute enimse proliciunt,
dum potest, intendere et transitoriis seterna commutare. Quod
quidem intelligentes ..... quoddam coenobium Proemonstratensis
Ordinis in feudo nostro, opud Derham fundavimus, pro salute
atrimae meae, et patris et matris meae, et Domini Runulpht' dc
Gtoeivitlo et Bertee uxoris ejus qui nos nutrierunt. (Monosticon,
volvi. 899.) -Geoffry Fitn Peter is one of the attesting wit-
nesses to the Charter.

Diceto, sss-The good Bishop vas thus licensed by three
consecutive Metropolitans, the Venersble Anselm‚ Rnlph, and
William de Corboyl. It therefore appears that he did not con·
sider that the sanction given by the Archbishop for the time
being, bound his successore.
