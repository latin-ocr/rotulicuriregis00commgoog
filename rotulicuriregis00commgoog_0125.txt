The Bull granted by Pope Celestine for the restoration of
the Monks, is transcribed both by Hoveden and in the annals of
Burton‚ and it speaks of Hugh Nonant aa being then alive. 'ihc
narrative of Matthew Paris, which is very circumstantial, ascribes
the restoration of the Convent to Innocent III. his successor.¹
Some few os the Monks, as he says, had repaired to Rome, for
the purpose of inducing the Pope to restore the Monastery.
There they lingered: some, wearied out by disappointment and
poverty, quitted the Apostolic Court; others died; till at length
only one remained, Brother Thomas, who, from extreme want,
was often forced to beg his breed. About this time, Hugh de
Nonant, being on his way to Rome, suddenly sickened when in
Normandy. Conscious that his death was nigh, he sent far and
wide to the Clergy of the Province, entreating them to visit him

on his death bed. Before them he confessed his ains. In par-
ticular he acknowledged, with great grief, how he had expelled
the Monks of Coventiy, warring against them with mortal hatred3
and, earnestly entreating from the Abbot of Bec-Herlouin, that
he might be clothed with the habit of that order which he had
persecuted, he died.
